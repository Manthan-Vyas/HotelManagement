# Hotel Management System

>**<span style="color:red;">Note: This project is still under development and needs many fixes.</span>**
## Project Status: Active Development ðŸš§

This project is currently under **active development**, meaning new features and improvements are being added frequently. As a result:

- There are **small bugs** and unfinished features that are being addressed.
- The **test suite is outdated**, as changes have been made after the initial tests were written.
- As the developer, I am currently **learning how to write tests in Spring Boot**, so testing is an ongoing improvement process.
- Some features have been **manually tested and are working**, but automated tests may not fully cover them yet.
- The **documentation is incomplete**, and some parts of the code may not be fully explained.
- The **project structure and code quality** are being improved over time.
- **Feedback and contributions** are welcome!
- However, the project is **fully functional** and can be run locally.
- **Please check the `run-local` branch** for the latest updates and features.

## Overview

This is a Hotel Management System built with Java, Spring Boot, and Maven. It is just a demo project for managing hotel reservations, users, and rooms. The project includes various features such as HATEOAS, ResponseWrapper, internationalization (i18n), security, role-based authorization, custom validations, filters, exception handling, and mappers.

## Steps to Run the Project Locally
### Running the Project
To check out the project, clone the **`run-local`** branch and follow the setup instructions to run it locally. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine and switch to the `run-local` branch.
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/Manthan-Vyas/HotelManagement.git"
cd <repository-directory>
git checkout run-local
```

### 2. Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA
Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "Open" from the welcome screen. Navigate to the project directory and open it.

### 3. Start the Application from IntelliJ IDEA

### 4. Access the Application
Once the application is running, you can access it via `http://localhost:8080`. and the Swagger UI can be accessed via `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.

### 5. Access the H2 Console
To access the H2 console, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`. Use the following credentials:
- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: `password`

The application will be ready to use with the default configurations.

## Key Features

### HATEOAS
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is implemented to provide navigable links in API responses.

### ResponseWrapper
All API responses are wrapped in a standard format to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

### Internationalization (i18n)
The project supports multiple languages, allowing for internationalization of messages and labels. For now validation messages for English are supported.

### Security
Spring Security is used to secure the application, including role-based access control.

### Role-Based Auth
Different roles (e.g., Admin, User) have different access levels and permissions within the application.

### Custom Validations
Custom validation annotations are used to enforce business rules and constraints on data.

### Filters
Filters are used to process requests and responses, such as logging and authentication.

### Exception Handling
Global exception handling is implemented to manage and respond to errors consistently.

### Mapper
Custom Mappers are used to map between entities, DTOs, and models, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/akm/hotelmanagement` - Main source code
- `src/main/resources` - Configuration files
- `src/test/java/com/akm/hotelmanagement` - Test source code

## How It Works

### Entity -> DTO -> Model Conversions
Data is transferred between different layers of the application using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and models. Entities represent the database structure, DTOs are used for data transfer, and models are used for business logic.

### Controller -> Service -> Repository
The application follows a layered architecture, with controllers handling incoming requests, services processing business logic, and repositories interacting with the database.

### Filters
Filters are used to process incoming requests and outgoing responses. For example, logging filters can log request details, while authentication filters can verify user credentials.

### Exception Handling
Global exception handling is implemented to manage and respond to errors consistently. Custom exceptions are used to handle specific error cases.

### Dto(s)
There are separate DTOs for requests and responses, which are used to transfer data between the client and server.

### ResponseWrapper
Tried to wrap all responses in a `ResponseWrapper` class to provide a consistent structure. This includes metadata such as status, message, and data.

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "code": 200,
  "message": "OK",
  "data": {
    "id": "fc7b27ea-9544-4171-aac2-be5ef64046be",
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "username": "admin",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "links": [
      {
        "rel": "self",
        "href": "http://localhost:8081/users/admin"
      },
      {
        "rel": "reservations",
        "href": "http://localhost:8081/users/admin/reservations?page=0&size=10&sortBy=reservationDate&sortDir=asc{&filterBy,filterValue}"
      }
    ]
  },
  "error": {},
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-31T02:42:06.739513200",
    "apiVersion": "1.0",
    "requestId": "12",
    "server": "localhost",
    "environment": "dev"
  }
}
```

## Entities and Relationships

### Hotel
- Contains information about the hotel.
- Connected to multiple `Room` entities.

### Amenity
- Represents amenities available in the hotel.
- Can be associated with `Room` entities.

### User
- Represents a user of the system.
- Can have different roles (e.g., Admin, Guest).
- Connected to multiple `Reservation` entities.

### Room
- Represents a room in the hotel.
- Connected to a `Hotel` entity.
- Can have multiple `Amenity` entities.
- Connected to multiple `Reservation` entities.

### Reservation
- Represents a reservation made by a user.
- Connected to a `User` entity.
- Connected to a `Room` entity.

## Actions by Authority

### Admin
